With this project I played with persistence of vision.

Persistence of vision is the ability of our eye to retain the last image that it was exposed to for roughly 1/25 of a second. 

The idea here is that what you see does not really exit but is a construction of your brain based on its physicology.  

What this tells us is that basically what you are seeing with your eyes is an illusion something that is not really there,
but you see it clearly. I believe that this happens to very often in so many different ways and we struggle to find the 
true reasons about why somethivery often. 


“Since we can not change reality, let us change the eyes that see it
Nikos Kazantzakis.
I want to remind that reality is defined by us. We are absolute, but we see only what our eyes can percieve... vision one of our senses.
With this installation I will try to create an illusion, what physisists call “persistence of vision”. The phenomenon in which our eye retains
the last image that it was exposed to, for just 1/25 of a second. By leveraging on that effect i will show you that 
what you see is not always what exists on the physical world but a construct of your mind of your perception.
